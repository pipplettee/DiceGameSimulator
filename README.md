# Dice Game Simulator (Java Edition)

This project is a simple, multiplayer dice-rolling game built entirely in Java with a Swing GUI. Players take turns rolling a six-sided die, and the player with the highest roll wins the round.

## Features

- **Java-Based GUI**: The user interface is built using the Java Swing framework.
- **Multiple Players**: Supports 2 to 4 players.
- **Round-Based Gameplay**: Play as many rounds as you like.
- **Score Tracking**: Automatically tracks the number of wins for each player.
- **Tie Detection**: Correctly handles rounds where there is a tie for the highest score.
